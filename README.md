## ‚ö° Comparison with Twitch Launcher
This is an example of the time that KoalaLauncher takes to install a modpack in comparison to Twitch. Both tests are running at the same time over a 1Gbps network to ensure that the network doesn't impact the comparison.

- Koala Launcher: `52 seconds`

- Twitch Launcher: `2 minutes, 25 seconds`
